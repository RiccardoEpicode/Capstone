# Netlify configuration for the LEON frontend (React SPA)

[build]
  # No base needed — this file is already inside the FrontEnd/Leon folder
  # Build command
  command = "npm run build"
  # Folder Vite outputs the built files to
  publish = "dist"

# SPA routing fix
# React Router handles all navigation client-side.
# Without this rule, Netlify looks for a real file at every URL (e.g. /ChatSystem)
# and returns 404. This tells Netlify: serve index.html for any URL,
# let React Router read the URL and render the correct page.
